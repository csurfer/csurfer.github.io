<h2>Why the new website ?</h2>
<p>I need a website. After the tragic demise of my old website hosted on
<a class="reference external" href="http://hiox.com/">HIOX.com</a>, after it got <a class="reference external" href="http://hackread.com/86-indian-websites-hacked-by-bangladeshi-black-hat-hackers/">hacked by Bagladeshi Black Hat hackers</a>, I
never got the time to resurrect my website. The fact that its working
now means that I am bored and I have free time on my hands.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-octopress">
<h2>Why Octopress ?</h2>
<p>Firstly one should learn from their mistakes. But when I got hacked I
couldn’t figure out where exactly the problem was. Was it the cPanel of
<a class="reference external" href="http://hiox.com">HIOX.com</a> which was faulty or did the attack
originate from the loop hole in <a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> plugin which I used to
power my blog ? Wordpress team says that it was due to mistake of the
website owners on their <a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/hack-by-bangladesh-black-hat-hackers-1">support site</a> but then I am not a person who
leaves too many loose ends nor uses weak passwords(I may not know too
much but I do know a thing or two).</p>
<p>Second the idea of a statically generated website intrigues me. After
all <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> is cool. Who wouldn’t love the idea of a program
which writes a program. I mean thats one of the ways you can enter
Nolan’s shoes.</p>
<p>Thirdly I fell in love with <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> when I was documenting my
research work in my <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/datascienceslab/">lab</a> and Octopress provides me with the option to
write my blog posts in markdown.</p>
